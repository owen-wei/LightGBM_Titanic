# LightGBM_Titanic
The titanic.csv file contains data for 887 of the real Titanic passengers. 

Each row represents one person. The columns describe different attributes about the person including whether they survived , their age, their passenger-class, their sex and the fare they paid. 

By using the LightGBM, I predict the passengers who can survive or not.
